Complete this 'cheat sheet' to consolidate what you've learned from the reading, and to practice using R markdown's LaTeX formatting for equations. You don't have to complete this in R markdown, if you would rather write it by hand, but being able to format mathematical equations help prepare you for your final project.

You should be able to complete most of this from the reading, buy may need to call on knowledge from previous courses and/or read some help documention for R functions.

# Discrete random variables
Link: [3.3 Discrete random variables](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-distthry.html#discrete-random-variables)

## Binary or Bernoulli distributions
Link: [3.3.1 Binary Random Variable](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-distthry.html#sec-binary)

* What is the probability distribution function? 

$$P(Y = y) = p^y(1-p)^{1-y} \ \text{for} \ y \in \{0, 1\} $$

* What is/are the parameter(s)?

There is one parameter for the Bernoulli distribution. It is $p$, the probability that $y$ takes the value 1. $y$ takes the value 0 with probability $1-p$.

* How do changes to the the parameter(s) effect the response?

Higher values of $p$ mean a great chance of getting a 1 (a 'success').

* What are the __mean__ and __variance__?

Mean: $\text{E}(Y) = p$

Variance: $var(Y) = p(1-p)$

* What values can your response variable, $y$, take?

Y can only take the value 0 or 1.

* When might you use this distribution? Come up with an example.

When there is just one trial with a binary outcome. Like one person's COVID test, where $p$ is the probability they test positive on the test.

* What R code can you use to explore the density of this distribution?

I wouldn't usually 'code' a Bernoulli distribution, but it IS one case of the binomial, so the below gives you what you would suspect.

```{r}
dbinom(1, size = 1, prob = .25)
```

* Can you simulate the distribution? Play with the parameters for yourself.

Just one observation, so boring, but sure...

```{r}
tibble(p = 0.25) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.01) +
  xlim(0,1) +
  labs(title = "A very boring plot of a single probability") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Binomial
Link: [3.3.2 Binomial Random Variable](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-distthry.html#sec-binomial)

* What is the probability distribution function? 

* What is/are the parameter(s)?

* How do changes to the the parameter(s) effect the response?

* What are the __mean__ and __variance__?

* What values can your response variable take?

* When might you use this distribution? Come up with an example.

* What R code can you use to explore the density of this distribution?

```{r}

```

* Can you simulate the distribution?

`rbinom()` generates random observations from the binomial distribution, with the parameters you specify. `rbinom(n = 1000, size = 10, p = 0.5)` means you want 1000 observations, each of 10 trials, with equal probability of getting a 0 or a 1 on each trial.

```{r}
# simulate the data and store it in a convenient way to plot
rand_bin <- tibble(y = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 10, p = 0.5))

# plot
rand_bin %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(y))) +
  geom_bar() + # appropriate for discrte count of successes
  labs(title = "Number of successes in 10 trials",
       subtitle = "1000 simulations",
         x = "Number of successes out of 10 trials",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Negative binomial
Link: [3.3.4 Negative Binomial Random Variable](https://bookdown.org/roback/bookdown-BeyondMLR/ch-distthry.html#negative-binomial-random-variable)

* What is the probability distribution function? 

* What is/are the parameter(s)?

* What are the __mean__ and __variance__?

* What values can your response variable take?

* When might you use this distribution? Come up with an example.

* What R code can you use to explore this distribution?

`dnbinom()` is the function to look at. Run ?dnbinom in your console for the help information. See the reading for more.

```{r}

```

* Can you simulate the distribution? Play with the parameters for yourself.

`rnbinom()` is the function to look at. Run ?rnbinom in your console for the help information.

```{r}
# simulate the data and store it in a convenient way to plot
rand_negbin <- tibble(y = rnbinom(n = 1000, size = 3, p = 0.35))

# plot
rand_negbin %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(y))) +
  geom_bar() + # appropriate for discrte count of successes
  labs(title = "Number of failures before the rth success",
       subtitle = "1000 simulations",
         x = "Number of failures",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
