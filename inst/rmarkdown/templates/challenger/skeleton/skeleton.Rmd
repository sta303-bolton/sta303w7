This template runs through the same analysis as the Challenger shuttle disaster case study.

## Shuttle data

On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, killing all seven crew members. The spacecraft **disintegrated** over the Atlantic Ocean. The disintegration of the vehicle began after a joint in its right rocket booster failed at liftoff. The failure was caused by the **failure of O-ring seals** used in the joint that were not designed to handle the unusually cold conditions that existed at this launch.

We will look at a data set about the number of rubber O-rings showing thermal distress for 23 flights of the space shuttle, with the ambient temperature and pressure at which tests on the putty next to the rings were performed.


```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r shuttle, echo=TRUE}
# You may need to install this package to get the data
# install.packages("SMPracticals")
data('shuttle', package='SMPracticals')
rownames(shuttle) <- as.character(rownames(shuttle))
shuttle[1:4,]
```

- `m`: number of rings
- `r`: number of damaged rings

Thus we have a situation where we are interested in the number of successes out of a fixed number of trials. Hopefully your memories of the Binomial distibution are being triggered by that language.

```{r shuttlePlot, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2}
# Base R plot
# plot(shuttle$temperature, shuttle$r/shuttle$m)

# ggplot
shuttle %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = temperature, y = r/m)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Are shuttle rings more likely to get damaged in cold weather? 

We can think of __m__ as the number of trials, and __r__ as the number of "successes". (It feels weird to call damage a success, but it is our outcome of interest, so we treat it as such.)

\begin{align*}
Y_i \sim & \text{Binomial}(N_i, \mu_i)\\
\log\left(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}\right) = & X_i \beta
\end{align*}

- m: number of rings, $N_i$
- r: number of damaged rings $Y_i$
- pressure, temperature: covariates $X_i$
- $\mu_i$: probability of a ring becoming damaged given $X_i$ 
- $\beta_{\text{temperature}}$: parameter of interest


## Inference: parameter estimation

\begin{align*}
Y_i \sim & G (\mu_i, \theta)\\
h(\mu_i) = & X_i \beta\\
\pi(Y_1 ... Y_N; \beta, \theta)  = & 
\prod_{i=1}^N f_G (Y_i ; \mu_i, \theta)\\
\log L(\beta, \theta ; y_1 ... y_N) = &
\sum_{i=1}^N \log f_G (y_i; \mu_i, \theta)
\end{align*}


- The $Y_i$ are *independently distributed*
- **Joint density** $\pi$ of random variables $(Y_1  ...Y_N)$ is the product of the marginal
densities $f_G$.
- **Likelihood function** $L$ given observed data $y_1 ... y_N$ is a function of the parameters.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**:
$$
\hat\beta, \hat\theta = \text{argmax}_{\beta,\theta}L(\beta, \theta ; y_1 \ldots y_N)
$$
- The best parameters are those which are most likely to produce the observed
  data

## Shuttle example in R

- `glm` works like `lm` with a `family` argument.
- Binomial models can take two types of inputs:
  - If, as in this case, we have groups of trials, we need our response to be a matrix with two columns: `y` and `N-y`.
  - If our `y` is a single 0/1 (or otherwise binary categorical variable) then we can set it up as usual, just a single column.

```{r shuttleEx, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
shuttle$notDamaged <- shuttle$m - shuttle$r
shuttle$y <- as.matrix(shuttle[,c('r','notDamaged')])
shuttleFit <- glm(y ~ temperature + pressure, 
  family=binomial(link='logit'), data=shuttle)
shuttleFit$coef
```


## Summary of fit


```{r shuttleSummary, echo=TRUE}
summary(shuttleFit)
```

```{r}
confint(shuttleFit)
```

There is no evidence that pressure is significantly associated with failure of O-rings...but how do we interpret these values?

## Interpreting logistic models

\begin{align*}
Y_i \sim & \text{Binomial}(N_i, \mu_i)\\
\log\left(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}\right) = & \sum_{p=1}^P X_{ip} \beta_p\\
\left(\frac{\mu_i}{1-\mu_i}\right) = & \prod_{p=1}^P \exp(\beta_p)^{X_{ip}}
\end{align*}

- $\mu_i$ is a probability
- $\log[\mu_i / (1-\mu_i)]$ is a log-odds
- $\mu_i / (1-\mu_i)$ is an odds
- If $\mu_i \approx 0$, then $\mu_i \approx \mu_i / (1-\mu_i)$ 


\begin{align*}
\beta_q = &\log\left(\frac{\mu_2}{1-\mu_2}\right) - \log\left(\frac{\mu_1}{1-\mu_1}\right) \\
\exp(\beta_q) = & \left(\frac{\mu_2}{1-\mu_2}\right) \left/ \left(\frac{\mu_1}{1-\mu_1}\right)\right. \\
\end{align*}

- $\beta_q$ is the log-odds ratio
- $\exp(\beta_q)$ is the odds ratio
- $\exp(\text{intercept})$ is the baseline odds, when $X_{1} \ldots X_{n} = 0$.


## Centring parameters

```{r shuttleC, echo=TRUE}
quantile(shuttle$temperature)
quantile(shuttle$pressure)
```


- Currently the intercept is log-odds when temperature = 0 and pressure = 0
- centre the covariates so the intercept refers to: 
  - temperature = 70 (degrees Farenheit)
  - pressure = 200 (pounds per square inch)


```{r shuttleFitC, echo=TRUE}
shuttle$temperatureC <- shuttle$temperature  - 70
shuttle$pressureC <-  shuttle$pressure - 200
shuttleFit2 <-  glm(y ~ temperatureC + pressureC, family='binomial', data=shuttle)
```


## Shuttle odds parameters

```{r shuttleSummaryExpSetup, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
par_table = cbind(est = summary(
  shuttleFit2)$coef[,1],
  confint(shuttleFit2))
rownames(par_table)[1]= "Baseline"
```


```{r shuttleSummaryExp, echo=TRUE}
round(exp(par_table),3)
```

**Table 1**: MLEs of baseline odds and odds ratios, with  95% confidence intervals.


## Interpreting shuttle parameters

- The odds of a ring being damaged when temperature = 70 and pressure = 200  is `r signif(exp(par_table[1,'est']), 3)`, which corresponds to a probability of


```{r shuttleBaselineProb, echo=TRUE, tidy=FALSE}
round(exp(par_table[1,'est']) / (1+exp(par_table[1,'est'])), 3)
```

- Each degree increase in temperature (in Farenheit) decreases the odds of damage by
(in percent)
```{r shuttleTemperaturePercent, echo=TRUE}
round(100*(1-exp(par_table[2,'est']) ), 3)
```
